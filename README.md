# British-Airways-Virtual-Internship-Task-2

Explore and prepare the dataset
First, spend some time exploring the dataset in the “Getting Started” Jupyter
Notebook provided in the Resources folder (4.1) to understand the different
columns and some basic statistics of the dataset. Then, you should consider how
to prepare the dataset for a predictive model. You should think about any new
features you want to create in order to make your model even better. You can
make use of the Resources provided to get you started with this task.

Train a machine learning model
When your data is ready for modeling, you should train a machine learning model
to be able to predict the target outcome, which is a customer making a booking.
For this task, you should use an algorithm that easily allows you to output
information about how each variable within the model contributes to its predictive
power. For example, a RandomForest is very good for this purpose.

Evaluate model and present findings
After training your model, you should evaluate how well it performed by
conducting cross-validation and outputting appropriate evaluation metrics.
Furthermore, you should create a visualization to interpret how each variable
contributed to the model. Finally, you should summarize your findings in a single
slide to be sent to your manager. Use the “PowerPoint Template” provided in the
Resources folder (4.2) to create your summary and make use of the links provided
to help with this task.
It is recommended that the analysis portion of this task is done in Python.

After completing your PowerPoint, You need to submit your document .
Estimated time for task completion: 1 hour, depending on your learning style.
